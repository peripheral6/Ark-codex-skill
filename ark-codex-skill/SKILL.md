# Arknights Deskpet

Build a transparent Codex deskpet from PRTS operator models and add it to a reusable deskpet library.

This skill generates a standalone Windows Python app, not a Codex Settings > Custom pets import. Explain that distinction when users ask for a native Codex pet.

## Workflow

1. Confirm operator name and optional skin. If no skin is given, use the default (默认).
2. Resolve the operator page title on PRTS, then export base (基建) WebM animations: `Default`, `Interact`, `Move`, `Relax`, `Sit`, `Sleep`.
3. Process the WebM files into 1000x1000 transparent PNG frames at 20fps and write `pets/<operator>/manifest.json`.
4. Add the pet to the deskpet library and launch it. The app supports right-click switching through the `桌宠库` menu.

## Quick Start on a Fresh Machine

The deskpet is a Windows Python app. Python 3.10+ and network access to `prts.wiki` are required. Do not use a global environment; always create a project-local `.venv`.

```bash
# 1. Scaffold a new deskpet project and its venv
python scripts/scaffold_deskpet.py --target <project-dir> --pet "<operator>"
python scripts/setup_env.py <project-dir>

# 2. Export WebM from PRTS (default skin unless --skin is given)
<project-dir>/.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/prts_export.py "<operator>" [--skin "<skin>"] --out <project-dir>/work/webm

# 3. Convert WebM to transparent frames and add to the pet library
<project-dir>/.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/process_webm.py --src <project-dir>/work/webm --name "<operator>" --out <project-dir>/pets/<operator>

# 4. Launch
<project-dir>/启动桌宠.bat
```

## Scripts

- `scripts/scaffold_deskpet.py` copies the app template into a project and writes an initial `settings.json`.
- `scripts/setup_env.py` creates `.venv`, installs `PySide6` and `playwright`, and optionally installs Playwright Chromium.
- `scripts/prts_export.py` automates the PRTS model viewer: loads the model, selects skin/model group/animation, and downloads WebM files.
- `scripts/process_webm.py` decodes WebM in Chromium, extracts transparent PNG frames, computes bounding boxes, and writes the pet manifest.
- `scripts/create_shortcuts.py` creates 打开桌宠 shortcuts on the Desktop and in the Start Menu.

## Notes

- The PRTS `Default` WebM export is often a broken 110-byte file. Keep it in `webm/` for reference, but do not map it to a state.
- If PRTS changes its viewer DOM, update `references/prts-ui.md` and the selectors inside `scripts/prts_export.py`.
- The generated app remembers position, size, and speed per pet, supports a mini mode, and can auto-hide in fullscreen.
- A lightweight watcher spawns a separate tray process while ChatGPT/Codex runs. The tray offers `显示桌宠`, `隐藏桌宠` (closes the pet), `开机自启动`, and `退出` (closes pet, tray, and watcher). The tray disappears when the app closes.
- The app template ships with 予愿安洁莉娜 as the initial pet, so a fresh project can launch immediately.
- 遥 (default outfit) is also bundled: scaffold with `--pet "遥"` to use it without downloading again.
- Generated apps inherit event-driven monitoring and status-linked actions. Polling runs in a background worker every 250ms; log-write latency is still possible. The app follows the newest log at startup, then stays on that task. Users can set a task ID in Settings to change the target; never embed the generating conversation's ID in a shared template.
- Settings include an action-link toggle and Chinese/English status captions. Captions are status-only, centered, transparent, and wrap if needed; task text is not translated.
- Completion/interruption are based on explicit log events, not file age. A crashed Codex process without a terminal event cannot be reliably detected from the rollout alone. Only local rollout files are read; ChatGPT process detection does not provide ChatGPT task telemetry.
- Scaffold into an empty directory. Do not overwrite existing settings or virtual environments when preparing updates.
